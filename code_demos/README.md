# How to setup/Run

When you run the assignTA.py file the file shows a list of all the classes that need a TA and it first gives off a list of all the classes that need a student. 
The information that is given is the Subject of the class, then the proffesor for that class, the start time, and finally it give the option for a 392 class or a 492 class.
The code prints all of these and it look like this:

--------------------------------------
Subject: CS392
Professor: Palmquist,Bruce C
Start Time: :AM
392 Assignment: None
492 Assignment: None
--------------------------------------

Some opf those classes have the 392/492 Assignment filled with the class number that the students will be assigned to.
