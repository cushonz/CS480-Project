# How to setup/Run

All you have to do is [this](https://cwu.instructure.com/courses/82313/assignments/1202138) and the [powerpoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PLuy4J-naOdw9Zq-nvwW8J2EetVk_bSlAA6T_AmfMjU/edit?usp=sharing)

when you run the assignTA.py file the file shows a list of all the classes that need a TA and it first gives off a list of all the classes that need a student. 
The information that is given is the Subject of the class, then the proffesor for that class, the start time, and finally it give the option for a 392 class or a 492 class.
The code prints all of these and it look like this:

--------------------------------------
Subject: CS392
Professor: Palmquist,Bruce C
Start Time: :AM
392 Assignment: None
492 Assignment: None
--------------------------------------

some opf those classes have the 392/492 Assignment filled with the class number that the students will be assigned to.
